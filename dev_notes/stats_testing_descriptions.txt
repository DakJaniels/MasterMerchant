The concept implemented by the `calculateAdjustedPercentileContextFactor` function can be related to "Comparative Percentiles" or "Contextual Percentiles." However, there isn't a standard statistical term that precisely matches the functionality of this function.

In essence, the function is calculating a modified percentile value (context factor) for a dataset based on a comparison with another dataset. It adjusts the percentile by considering the mean difference between the two datasets and applying a maximum allowable deviation. This process aims to provide a more contextually relevant perspective on the percentile value for the given dataset.

While the specific implementation and calculations performed by the function are unique, the underlying idea of adjusting a percentile based on contextual factors aligns with the broader concept of comparative or contextual analysis in statistics.
